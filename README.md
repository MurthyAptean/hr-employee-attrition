This project was created as part of the INSAID capstone project.
The key to success in an organization is the ability to attract and retain top talents. It is vital for the Human Resource (HR) Department to identify the factors that keep employees and those which prompt them to leave. Companies could do more to prevent the loss of good people.

This project is based on a hypothetical dataset downloaded from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance.

This dataset describes each employee's background and characteristics. Machine Learning models can help to understand and determine how these factors relate to workforce attrition
